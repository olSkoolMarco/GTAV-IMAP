Back the ambulance into the garage right up against the back wall. The best placement is a little off center to the right of the garage. 4. Jump onto the roof and head to the back wall. Aim up to the air duct above you. Your gonna want to jump diagonally towards the spot where the duct work meets the back wall of the garage. 5. Enjoy! Once inside you can walk above the garage you entered through. Kind of a limit to the uses of this wall breach as you can only shoot down through the ceiling of the garage. Either way, I hope someone in the community enjoys this and can out use to it. Thank you for your time.",

The UFO Wreckage can be found off the coast of Paleto Bay (north of Procopio Beach). And appears to have crash-landed into the ocean and is now laying on the ocean floor. Some weeds and underwater debris have collected on the top of the UFO, hinting that it has been there for some time. After the mission Three's Company, there is a Weazel News segment on the radio in which a hiker (Omega) mentions seeing a UFO crash into the ocean. It is thought that this UFO could also be the source of the Spaceship Parts scattered around San Andreas. Breach: To enter to UFO, swim underneath the base of the craft and into breach, which reveals a circular room with alien like symbols inscribed on floor?. Tips: Stockup on plenty of Re-Breathers before going to this site....it is also recommended to get a Submarine from the Sonar Collections Dock at Paleto Cove.",

The FlyUS logo is barely visible on the front piece of the aircraft. From the lack of coral around the fuselage suggest it might have crashed in the sea not much before the events of the game. The first time I came across this wreck, I thought it maybe a tribute to the Cast Away Movie (starring Tom Hanks). Mainly due to the fact that it is the same design as used by FedEx. A company named FlyUs does exist, however it is not a passenger airliner, and operates in the Netherlands and Belgium - yet, the real life FlyUs logo does bear a resemblance to the GTA FlyUS logo. ",

Jock wanted to leave Blaine County to pursue his dreams of becoming a stuntman, but Jolene wanted to stay, saying that she had to look after her parents and run their thriving guest house. Therefore, whilst out walking by the cliffs overlooking the El Gordo Lighthouse, Jock pushed Jolene over the edge of the cliffs and she fell to her death. The police arrested Jock on suspicion of murder, but he was released without charge after the police investigation concluded that Jolene's death was accidental. Haunting: Her spirit appears at the top of Mount Gordo at night, between 23:00 and 00:00. When the player approaches it, it disappears (although can always been seen through a sniper rifle scope). She has a permanent petrified open-mouthed look on her face, as well as leaves rotating around her. The only movement the spirit makes is a very slight bobbing in a circular motion. Moans can occasionally be heard from her. On the rock that the ghost floats over, the name Jock is written with blood, accusing her husband of murder.",
