Back the ambulance into the garage right up against the back wall. The best placement is a little off center to the right of the garage. 4. Jump onto the roof and head to the back wall. Aim up to the air duct above you. Your gonna want to jump diagonally towards the spot where the duct work meets the back wall of the garage. 5. Enjoy! Once inside you can walk above the garage you entered through. Kind of a limit to the uses of this wall breach as you can only shoot down through the ceiling of the garage. Either way, I hope someone in the community enjoys this and can out use to it. Thank you for your time.",

There are fall through areas all over this breach. It has shooting areas above, and to the sides that I will point out, and it is a pretty useful wallbreach. Explore this breach and find something new. Feel free to use this tutorial however you see fit - but please be sure to give me some credit for pointing it out.",
